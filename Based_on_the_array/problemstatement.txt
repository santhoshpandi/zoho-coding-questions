Coding Question 2: Based on the Array

Input: [2,1,0,-8,-9]
Output: 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.4

Explanation:

    First, find the total number of elements in the array = 5
    Find the total number of positive numbers=2
    Find the total number of neutral numbers=1
    (0 is the only neutral number)
    Find the total number of negative numbers=2
    Output = [ (no of positive number/length of the array), (no of neutral numbers/length of the array), (no of negative numbers/length of the array) ]
    =[⅖, ⅕, ⅖]
    =[0.4, 0.2, 0.4]
